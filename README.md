A Reversi iOS Game.

I wrote this in a few hours as my first iOS application to teach
myself iOS programming. This is probably NOT a good place for you
to teach yourself how to code for iOS because I probably did
everything wrong.

The AI is still extremely rudimentary; it simply picks a valid
move that will result in taking the most number of pieces in
the next move.

There's not yet any GameCenter integration, sounds, music, two
player network mode, or anything. It's all quite basic, but it
works. :)

TODOs:
 - sophisticated minmix AI with multilevel lookahead
 - sound effects
 - music
 - animations
 - GameCenter / multiplayer
